# Factory presets

Nine factory presets ship with Silentium v0.2.0, embedded via BinaryData from
`presets/factory/*.json`. All are sourced from `docs/design-brief.md`'s
"Factory Presets" section - see that document's own Honesty section for what
these numbers are and aren't calibrated against (research/manual/forum-
derived, not measured hardware).

| Preset | Category | Intent |
|---|---|---|
| **Default** | Init | The v0.2.0 out-of-the-box parameter layout defaults (Threshold -40 dB, Attack 1 ms, Hold 20 ms, Release 80 ms, Range -60 dB, SC HPF 80 Hz, SC LPF 16 kHz/off) - the certified starting point and this plugin's default-resolution target (see the M2 default-resolution order in `basilica-audio/nave`'s `docs/preset-system-notes.md`, the pilot's replication recipe). |
| **Surgical Mute** | Guitar | Maximum inter-note silence for tightly palm-muted rhythm parts (Range -80 dB, fast 0.5 ms attack, 15 ms hold) - the "surgical/tight" camp from research (Nail The Mix's "-∞ dB or its maximum setting"). |
| **Natural Decay** | Guitar | Partial-reduction gating (Range -16 dB, 6 dB knee, slower 150 ms release) that avoids the audibly-gated pump on sustained chords - the "-12 to -20 dB partial reduction sounds more natural" camp. |
| **Pick Attack Focus** | Guitar | Same tight ballistics as Surgical Mute, but SC HPF/LPF narrowed to 1.5-5 kHz to key detection specifically off the guitar pick-attack transient band cited by research, less sensitive to sustained low-mid buzz/hum. |
| **DI-Keyed Workflow** | Guitar | Moderate, v0.1/v0.2-shared-default ballistics, documented for use with a clean DI feeding Silentium's External Sidechain input bus (bus routing is a host-level setting outside APVTS, so this preset ships the ballistics side of the "gold standard" DI-keyed workflow; enable External Sidechain in your host's routing matrix separately). |
| **Ambient Sustain** | Guitar | Long hold/release (200/400 ms) plus partial Range (-24 dB) and a wide 12 dB knee for a soft, program-material-following close on clean/ambient high-headroom parts where a hard gate would sound obviously gated. |
| **Chug Lock** | Guitar | Fast palm-mute 8th/16th-note chugging at high tempo: 0 ms Attack (the new v0.2.0 floor) so no audible ramp reads as smear, tight 10/40 ms hold/release, full -80 dB Range. |
| **Duck Under Lead** | Guitar | Demonstrates Duck mode as a rhythm-ducks-under-lead effect (Duck on, moderate -10 dB Range, slow 200 ms release) rather than pure noise reduction, keeping the M1 Duck feature discoverable. |
| **Listen Check** | Guitar | Diagnostic/onboarding preset (Listen on, everything else at Default): loading it immediately auditions what the detection path hears, answering "why isn't my gate opening" without reading the manual. |
