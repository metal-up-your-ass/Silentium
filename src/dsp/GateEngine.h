// The complete Silentium signal path, independent of juce::AudioProcessor so
// it can be exercised directly by unit tests without instantiating a full
// plugin (see tests/EngineTests.cpp). Owns all DSP state; every buffer/
// filter/delay-line is allocated in prepare() and never reallocated on the
// audio thread.
//
// Signal flow (see docs/architecture.md and docs/design-brief.md for the
// full v0.2.0 diagram):
//
//   Detection path (never reaches the output):
//     input -> SC HPF (sidechain-only) -> SC LPF (sidechain-only, v0.2.0,
//     off/fully-open by default) -> stereo-linked max|.| -> peak envelope
//     follower -> dBFS -> hysteresis comparator + hold timer -> knee blend
//     -> program-dependent attack/release gain ramp (dB domain, floor =
//     Range)
//
//   Main path:
//     input -> lookahead delay -> * gain (from the detection path, applied
//     identically to every channel: a stereo-linked gate never shifts the
//     stereo image) -> output
//
// The gate uses separate open/close thresholds (Threshold, and Threshold
// minus a fixed internal hysteresis amount) so a signal hovering right at
// Threshold cannot chatter the gate open and closed on every sample - this is
// what tests/EngineTests.cpp's hysteresis test verifies. Range == 0 dB means
// the floor is 0 dB below unity, i.e. the gate never attenuates at all; this
// is used as an "always open" reference passthrough in the null test.
//
// SC LPF (v0.2.0) is a second, independent sidechain-only filter stage in
// series after SC HPF, so the detection path can be narrowed toward the
// documented guitar pick-attack transient band (roughly 2-5 kHz) instead of
// only having its bottom end rejected - see docs/design-brief.md's "SC LPF"
// section. It defaults to 16 kHz (effectively fully open at typical sample
// rates), so a v0.1.0 session that never touches it reproduces v0.1.0
// behaviour exactly (tests/DesignBriefTests.cpp's SC LPF null test).
//
// Attack/Release (v0.2.0) drive a program-dependent exponential ramp rather
// than v0.1's fixed dB/sample linear slope - see setAttackMs()/setReleaseMs()
// and process()'s gain-computer comment for the exact mechanism and the
// honesty note on why this specific curve shape was chosen.
//
// Three optional, off-by-default refinements sit on top of that same
// hysteresis/hold state machine (see process()):
//
//   - Knee softens the gain computer's target into a smooth blend across a
//     band centred on Threshold, instead of an instant snap between Range
//     and 0 dB; Hold still overrides the blend to guarantee a fully open
//     target for its whole duration, exactly as it does at Knee == 0.
//   - Duck inverts that same target (attenuate above Threshold instead of
//     opening above it), turning the gate into a ducker without touching
//     the detection path.
//   - Listen substitutes the sidechain-filtered detection signal itself for
//     the gain computer's output, so the detector's trigger signal can be
//     auditioned directly.
//
// process() also optionally accepts an external sidechain block: when
// provided (non-null, non-empty), the detection path is fed from it instead
// of a copy of the main block, e.g. for keying off a kick drum or a second
// guitar track. Never written to; passed as non-const only because
// juce::dsp::AudioBlock does not offer a deep-const view.
