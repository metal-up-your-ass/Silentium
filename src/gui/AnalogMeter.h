// Suite-reusable analog-style VU meter: draws an incandescent pilot-lamp
// glow and the rotating needle, composited live on top of the baked dial
// face already present in Silentium's faceplate background (see
// PluginEditor.cpp). Also OWNS the peak-hold/fade state machine for the
// peak LED (it owns the dB data), even though - as of v0.3.6 - the LED's own
// IMAGE DRAW lives in PluginEditor instead (see peakLedAlpha() below and
// this header's Assets docs for why).
//
// v0.3.4: MASTER-05 BASELINE ARCHITECTURE, per Yves' final art direction,
// superseding v0.3.3's "true component assembly" (every visual element as
// its own standalone master-reference asset). master-05 bakes BOTH VU dial
// faces directly into the single faceplate image (ticks, "VU" wordmark, red
// zone, hub/anchor bar, brass bezel - everything except the needle and the
// peak LED, which stay live overlays) - so this component no longer owns or
// draws a face image at all. The pivot fraction remains a configurable
// constructor parameter (the baked face's own hub does not sit at the exact
// centre of the component's bounds - measured ~47.8%/66.6% across/down, see
// PluginEditorLayout.h's meterPivotXFraction/meterPivotYFraction docs) -
// PluginEditorLayout.h/PluginEditor.cpp compute this component's bounds
// directly from the master-05 measurements so the needle/glow land correctly
// on the already-baked dial.
//
// v0.3.6: the peak LED moved OUT of this component's own draw entirely.
// Per Yves' master-03 reference the LED is a SMALL lamp sitting ON THE
// PLATE, outside each dial's bezel (upper-left) - not inside the dial face
// this component's own bounds cover. A prior revision incorrectly drew a
// large LED inside the dial over the tick scale; PluginEditor now owns the
// LED asset + draw call at the correct plate-level position (see
// PluginEditorLayout.h's ledLCentre1x/ledRCentre1x), reading this
// component's own ledAlpha via peakLedAlpha() each tick.
